# Exponent - Overview

Exponent is a modern task management application inspired by Linear.app, built to showcase advanced front-end engineering practices. With a focus on modular architecture, robust state management, and component-driven development, Exponent features a clean, customizable Kanban board interface for seamless task tracking and issue management.

Designed as a proof-of-concept for scalable, high-quality web apps, Exponent demonstrates best practices in TypeScript, React, and modern tooling (ESLint, Prettier). Although centered on task management, the architecture is flexible and extensible, laying the groundwork for future integrations like project and sprint planning.
